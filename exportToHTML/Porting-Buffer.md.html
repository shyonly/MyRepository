<span class="s2">also find calls to deprecated `Buffer</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">` API. Those rules are included in some pre-sets.</span>

<span class="s2">There is a drawback, though, that it doesn't always</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">work correctly</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://github.com/chalker/safer-buffer#why-not-safe-buffer</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">when `Buffer` is</span>
<span class="s2">overriden e.g. with a polyfill, so recommended is a combination of this and some other method</span>
<span class="s2">described above.</span>

<span class="s1">&lt;a id=&quot;variant-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Variant 1</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Drop support for Node.js ≤ 4.4.x and 5.0.0 — 5.9.x.</span>

<span class="s2">This is the recommended solution nowadays that would imply only minimal overhead.</span>

<span class="s2">The Node.js 5.x release line has been unsupported since July 2016, and the Node.js 4.x release line reaches its End of Life in April 2018 </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">→ </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Schedule</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule</span><span class="s1">))</span><span class="s2">. This means that these versions of Node.js will </span><span class="s1">*</span><span class="s2">not</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s2">receive any updates, even in case of security issues, so using these release lines should be avoided, if at all possible.</span>

<span class="s2">What you would do in this case is to convert all `new Buffer</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">` or `Buffer</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">` calls to use `Buffer.alloc</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">` or `Buffer.from</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">`, in the following way</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">For `new Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">number</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">`, replace it with `Buffer.alloc</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">number</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">`.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">For `new Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">string</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">or `new Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">string, encoding</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">, replace it with `Buffer.from</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">string</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">or `Buffer.from</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">string, encoding</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">For all other combinations of arguments </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">these are much rarer</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">, also replace `new Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">...arguments</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">` with `Buffer.from</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">...arguments</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">`.</span>

<span class="s2">Note that `Buffer.alloc</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">` is also </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">faster</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">on the current Node.js versions than</span>
<span class="s2">`new Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">size</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.fill</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">0</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">`, which is what you would otherwise need to ensure zero-filling.</span>

<span class="s2">Enabling eslint rule </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">no-buffer-constructor</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-buffer-constructor</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">is recommended to avoid accidential unsafe Buffer API usage.</span>

<span class="s2">There is also a </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">JSCodeshift codemod</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://github.com/joyeecheung/node-dep-codemod#dep005</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s2">for automatically migrating Buffer constructors to `Buffer.alloc</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">` or `Buffer.from</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">`.</span>
<span class="s2">Note that it currently only works with cases where the arguments are literals or where the</span>
<span class="s2">constructor is invoked with two arguments.</span>

<span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">If you currently support those older Node.js versions and dropping them would be a semver-major change</span>
<span class="s2">for you, or if you support older branches of your packages, consider using </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Variant 2</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">#variant-2</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s2">or </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Variant 3</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">#variant-3</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">on older branches, so people using those older branches will also receive</span>
<span class="s2">the fix. That way, you will eradicate potential issues caused by unguarded Buffer API usage and</span>
<span class="s2">your users will not observe a runtime deprecation warning when running your code on Node.js 10.</span><span class="s1">_</span>

<span class="s1">&lt;a id=&quot;variant-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Variant 2</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Use a polyfill</span>

<span class="s2">Utilize </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">safer-buffer</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://www.npmjs.com/package/safer-buffer</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">as a polyfill to support older</span>
<span class="s2">Node.js versions.</span>

<span class="s2">You would take exacly the same steps as in </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Variant 1</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">#variant-1</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">, but with a polyfill</span>
<span class="s2">`const Buffer = require</span><span class="s1">('</span><span class="s2">safer-buffer'</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.Buffer` in all files where you use the new `Buffer` api.</span>

<span class="s2">Make sure that you do not use old `new Buffer` API — in any files where the line above is added,</span>
<span class="s2">using old `new Buffer</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">` API will </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">throw</span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">. It will be easy to notice that in CI, though.</span>

<span class="s2">Alternatively, you could use </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">buffer-from</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer-from</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and/or</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">buffer-alloc</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer-alloc</span><span class="s1">) [</span><span class="s2">ponyfills</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://ponyfill.com/</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">—</span>
<span class="s2">those are great, the only downsides being 4 deps in the tree and slightly more code changes to</span>
<span class="s2">migrate off them </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">as you would be using e.g. `Buffer.from` under a different name</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">. If you need only</span>
<span class="s2">`Buffer.from` polyfilled — `buffer-from` alone which comes with no extra dependencies.</span>

<span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">Alternatively, you could use </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">safe-buffer</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-buffer</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">— it also</span>
<span class="s2">provides a polyfill, but takes a different approach which has</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">it's drawbacks</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://github.com/chalker/safer-buffer#why-not-safe-buffer</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">. It will allow you</span>
<span class="s2">to also use the older `new Buffer</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s2">` API in your code, though — but that's arguably a benefit, as</span>
<span class="s2">it is problematic, can cause issues in your code, and will start emitting runtime deprecation</span>
<span class="s2">warnings starting with Node.js 10.</span><span class="s1">_</span>

<span class="s2">Note that in either case, it is important that you also remove all calls to the old Buffer</span>
<span class="s2">API manually — just throwing in `safe-buffer` doesn't fix the problem by itself, it just provides</span>
<span class="s2">a polyfill for the new API. I have seen people doing that mistake.</span>

<span class="s2">Enabling eslint rule </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">no-buffer-constructor</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-buffer-constructor</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s2">or</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">node/no-deprecated-api</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-deprecated-api.md</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s2">is recommended.</span>

<span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">Don't forget to drop the polyfill usage once you drop support for Node.js </span><span class="s1">&lt; </span><span class="s2">4.5.0.</span><span class="s1">_</span>

<span class="s1">&lt;a id=&quot;variant-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Variant 3 — manual detection, with safeguards</span>

<span class="s2">This is useful if you create Buffer instances in only a few places </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">e.g. one</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">, or you have your own</span>
<span class="s2">wrapper around them.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">0</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">This special case for creating empty buffers can be safely replaced with `Buffer.concat</span><span class="s1">([])</span><span class="s2">`, which</span>
<span class="s2">returns the same result all the way down to Node.js 0.8.x.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">notNumber</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">Before</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">js</span>
<span class="s4">var buf = new Buffer(notNumber, encoding);</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">After</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">js</span>
<span class="s4">var buf;</span>
<span class="s4">if (Buffer.from &amp;&amp; Buffer.from !== Uint8Array.from) {</span>
  <span class="s4">buf = Buffer.from(notNumber, encoding);</span>
<span class="s4">} else {</span>
  <span class="s4">if (typeof notNumber === 'number')</span>
    <span class="s4">throw new Error('The &quot;size&quot; argument must be of type number.');</span>
  <span class="s4">buf = new Buffer(notNumber, encoding);</span>
<span class="s4">}</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">`encoding` is optional.</span>

<span class="s2">Note that the `typeof notNumber` before `new Buffer` is required </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">for cases when `notNumber` argument is not</span>
<span class="s2">hard-coded</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">is not caused by the deprecation of Buffer constructor</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">— it's exactly </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">why</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">the</span>
<span class="s2">Buffer constructor is deprecated. Ecosystem packages lacking this type-check caused numereous</span>
<span class="s2">security issues — situations when unsanitized user input could end up in the `Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">arg</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">` create</span>
<span class="s2">problems ranging from DoS to leaking sensitive information to the attacker from the process memory.</span>

<span class="s2">When `notNumber` argument is hardcoded </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">e.g. literal `</span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">abc</span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">` or `</span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">0,1,2</span><span class="s1">]</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">, the `typeof` check can</span>
<span class="s2">be omitted.</span>

<span class="s2">Also note that using TypeScript does not fix this problem for you — when libs written in</span>
<span class="s2">`TypeScript` are used from JS, or when user input ends up there — it behaves exactly as pure JS, as</span>
<span class="s2">all type checks are translation-time only and are not present in the actual JS code which TS</span>
<span class="s2">compiles to.</span>

<span class="s2">Otherwise </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">Node.js ≥ 0.12.x</span><span class="s1">):</span>

<span class="s2">leaking to the remote attacker.</span>

<span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">Note that the same applies to `new Buffer` usage without zero-filling, depending on the Node.js</span>
<span class="s2">version </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">and lacking type checks also adds DoS to the list of potential problems</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1">_</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">What is wrong with the `Buffer` constructor?</span>

<span class="s2">The `Buffer` constructor could be used to create a buffer in many different ways</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`new Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">42</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">` creates a `Buffer` of 42 bytes. Before Node.js 8, this buffer contained</span>

  <span class="s2">program source code to passwords and encryption keys.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`new Buffer</span><span class="s1">('</span><span class="s2">abc'</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">` creates a `Buffer` that contains the UTF-8-encoded version of</span>
  <span class="s2">the string `</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s2">abc'`. A second argument could specify another encoding</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">For example,</span>
  <span class="s2">`new Buffer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">string, </span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s2">base64'</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">` could be used to convert a Base64 string into the original</span>
  <span class="s2">sequence of bytes that it represents.</span>

<span class="s2">what exactly the contents of the generated buffer are</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s2">without knowing the type of `foo`.</span>

<span class="s2">Sometimes, the value of `foo` comes from an external source. For example, this function</span>
<span class="s2">could be exposed as a service on a web server, converting a UTF-8 string into its Base64 form</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s4">function stringToBase64(req, res) {</span>
