<pre><span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Streams Working Group</span>

<span class="s2">The Node.js Streams is jointly governed by a Working Group</span>
<span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">WG</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s2">that is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.</span>

<span class="s2">The WG has final authority over this project including</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">* </span><span class="s2">Technical direction</span>
<span class="s0">* </span><span class="s2">Project governance and process </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">including this policy</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s0">* </span><span class="s2">Contribution policy</span>
<span class="s0">* </span><span class="s2">GitHub repository hosting</span>
<span class="s0">* </span><span class="s2">Conduct guidelines</span>
<span class="s0">* </span><span class="s2">Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators</span>

<span class="s2">For the current list of WG members, see the project</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">README.md</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">./README.md#current-project-team-members</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Collaborators</span>

<span class="s2">The readable-stream GitHub repository is</span>
<span class="s2">maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by the</span>
<span class="s2">WG on an ongoing basis.</span>

<span class="s2">Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made</span>
<span class="s2">Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These</span>
<span class="s2">individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as</span>
<span class="s2">Collaborators is discussed during the WG meeting.</span>

<span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">Note</span><span class="s1">:_ </span><span class="s2">If you make a significant contribution and are not considered</span>
<span class="s2">for commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly and it</span>
<span class="s2">will be brought up in the next WG meeting.</span>

<span class="s2">Modifications of the contents of the readable-stream repository are</span>
<span class="s2">made on</span>
<span class="s2">a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a</span>
<span class="s2">modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project</span>
<span class="s2">Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a</span>
<span class="s2">Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full</span>
<span class="s2">responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed</span>
<span class="s2">by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required</span>
<span class="s2">for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators</span>
<span class="s2">participate and there is disagreement around a particular</span>
<span class="s2">modification. See </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">Consensus Seeking Process</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">below for further detail</span>
<span class="s2">on the consensus model used for governance.</span>

<span class="s2">Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial</span>
<span class="s2">modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the</span>
<span class="s2">WG for discussion by assigning the </span><span class="s1">***</span><span class="s2">WG-agenda</span><span class="s1">*** </span><span class="s2">tag to a pull</span>
<span class="s2">request or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where</span>
<span class="s2">required.</span>

<span class="s2">For the current list of Collaborators, see the project</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">README.md</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">./README.md#members</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">WG Membership</span>

<span class="s2">WG seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the WG.</span>
<span class="s2">However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate</span>
<span class="s2">coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to</span>
<span class="s2">make decisions efficiently.</span>

<span class="s2">There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG</span>
<span class="s2">membership beyond these rules.</span>

<span class="s2">The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.</span>

<span class="s2">A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by</span>
<span class="s2">unanimous consensus of all other WG members.</span>

<span class="s2">Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be</span>
<span class="s2">suggested as any other agenda item </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">see </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">WG Meetings</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">below</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.</span>

<span class="s2">If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full</span>
<span class="s2">WG is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal</span>
<span class="s2">is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensure</span>
<span class="s2">that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all</span>
<span class="s2">membership decisions.  If a WG member is unable to attend a meeting</span>
<span class="s2">where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent</span>
<span class="s2">is assumed.</span>

<span class="s2">No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same</span>
<span class="s2">employer.  If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of</span>
<span class="s2">employment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of</span>
<span class="s2">the WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be</span>
<span class="s2">immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG</span>
<span class="s2">members affiliated with the over-represented employer</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">s</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">WG Meetings</span>

<span class="s2">The WG meets occasionally on a Google Hangout On Air. A designated moderator</span>
<span class="s2">approved by the WG runs the meeting. Each meeting should be</span>
<span class="s2">published to YouTube.</span>

<span class="s2">Items are added to the WG agenda that are considered contentious or</span>
<span class="s2">are modifications of governance, contribution policy, WG membership,</span>
<span class="s2">or release process.</span>

<span class="s2">The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;</span>
<span class="s2">that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger</span>
<span class="s2">group of Collaborators.</span>

<span class="s2">Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to</span>
<span class="s2">the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,</span>
<span class="s2">WG member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding</span>
<span class="s2">the </span><span class="s1">***</span><span class="s2">WG-agenda</span><span class="s1">*** </span><span class="s2">tag to the issue.</span>

<span class="s2">Prior to each WG meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with</span>
<span class="s2">members of the WG. WG members can add any items they like to the</span>
<span class="s2">agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the WG</span>
<span class="s2">cannot veto or remove items.</span>

<span class="s2">The WG may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to</span>
<span class="s2">participate in a non-voting capacity.</span>

<span class="s2">The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each</span>
<span class="s2">agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Consensus Seeking Process</span>

<span class="s2">The WG follows a</span>
<span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Consensus</span>
<span class="s2">Seeking</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s3">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making</span><span class="s1">)</span>
<span class="s2">decision-making model.</span>

<span class="s2">When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator</span>
<span class="s2">will ask </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">Does anyone object?</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">as a final call for dissent from the</span>
<span class="s2">consensus.</span>

<span class="s2">If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for</span>
<span class="s2">either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next</span>
<span class="s2">meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG</span>
<span class="s2">or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.</span>

<span class="s2">Note that changes to WG membership require a majority consensus.  See</span>
<span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">WG Membership</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">above.</span>
